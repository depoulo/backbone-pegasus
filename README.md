> Improve your Backbone app loading time with [Pegasus](https://github.com/typicode/pegasus).

Using backbone-pegasus, you can start loading data while loading Backbone and other scripts.

## Usage

```html
<script src="backbone-pegasus.js"></script>
<script>

  // Start loading models and collections data
  BackbonePegasus.get('http://api.example.com/songs');
  BackbonePegasus.get('http://api.example.com/users');
  
</script>

<script src="jquery.js"></script>
<script src="underscore.js"></script>
<script src="backbone.js"></script>
<script src="app.js"></script>
<script>

  $(function() {
  
    // Set up backbone-pegasus
    BackbonePegasus.setup();
  
    // Start your app
    app.start();

  });

</script>
```

__There's nothing else to change in your app__ and you don't even have to use backbone-pegasus for all your URLs. 

In fact, if a model or collection requests an URL that wasn't loaded by backbone-pegasus, it simply falls back to making the request using Backbone.

## Example

You can find a working app in the example directory and this is what you should get.

Obviously, in production you should concatenate your app scripts. However, what's important in this screenshot is that your data (the yellow bar) is being loaded while still loading the other scripts.

Without server-side data bootstrapping or rendering, you would have to wait for all the scripts to load before starting to load data.

## Routing

To keep things light and fast, backbone-pegasus doesn't come with a router.

But depending on your needs, you can write your own:

```javascript
var base = 'http://api.example.com';

switch(window.location.hash) {
  case '#posts':
    BackbonePegasus.get(base + '/posts');
    break;
  case '#users':
    BackbonePegasus.get(base + '/users');
    break;
  default:
    BackbonePegasus.get(base + '/posts');
}
```

_Another [example](https://github.com/typicode/backbone-pegasus/blob/master/example/index.html#L37) can be found in the example directory._

You can also use a third-party library like [route-recognizer](https://github.com/tildeio/route-recognizer).
